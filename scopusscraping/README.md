# Data retrieval via the Scopus API

[![Project Status: Inactive â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state but is no longer being actively developed; support/maintenance will be provided as time allows.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/inactive.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#inactive)

The aim of this repository is to retrieve paper information from the [Scopus database](https://www.elsevier.com/en-gb/products/scopus), in an automated and efficient way, using their API. The query response can form a dataset to feed into the graph database made with [neo4j](https://gitlab.bham.ac.uk/missierp-ai4idai/neo4j).

## Accessing pre-run queries
 Thee queries use the full [list of University of Birmingham affiliations](data/uob_affils.csv). Also see this [scopus page](https://www.scopus.com/pages/organization/60019702#) for a summary of University of Birmingham Scopus documents.  

> The query responses are stored as json files on the Research Data Store (/rdsprojects/m/missierp-ai4idai/scopus_data). **If you are granted access to these and use them for your UoB research, it is assumed that you have read and agreed to the [API Service Agreement](https://dev.elsevier.com/policy/API-service-agreement.pdf), and also read Elsevier's policy on [Scopus API for academic research](https://dev.elsevier.com/academic_research_scopus.html).**

## Running your own queries

### Setting up your environment

Make a virtual python environment called 'venv_ai4idia' using the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file to install the required dependencies. Note, interaction with this code is presented as a Jupyter notebook, hence why there are many Jupyter-related dependencies listed in this requirements file. 

Installation example on a shell terminal:
- Create virtual Python environment: `python3 -m venv venv_ai4idia`
- Activate environment: `source venv_ai4idia/bin/activate`) 
- Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

### Obtain Scopus API Key

- Go to [Elsevier Developer Portal](https://dev.elsevier.com) and select 'I want an API key'
- After signing in with UoB credentials, follow their instructions to create an API key 
- Copy the API Key from their website into an empty file called `.env` (this file should be kept private and therefore is not be tracked by git by including it in [.gitignore](.gitignore). See [.env.example](.env.example) to see what this file looks like).
- Note, for this key authentication to work you may have to be on campus (or using the UoB VPN)

### Interactive Coding Notebook

The [scopus_api.ipynb](code/scopus_api.ipynb) file was written and executed as [notebook file in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks). If you want to run this coding notebook and create more query outputs from Scopus, you need to set up your environment with the necessary dependencies and authentications, as explained above.
